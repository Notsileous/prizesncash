 <h1>Proof</h1>
 <p>
 Anyone can say "hey! I made hundreds of dollars on the internet doing nothing and you can too! You would be right to be skeptical about that so here I will try to give you as much proof as I can, and you can be the judge.
 <br/>

 <a href="http://www.points2shop.com?ref=phatgreendog"><img src="http://points2shop.com//banners/phatgreendog" alt="A visual description of earnings from the site" class="floatleft"/></a>
 Here you see what is actually one of my referral links, it displays my real time earnings from the site. As you can see the totals are fairly large, the cash total is the total earned from referrals, events, and offers where i chose cash. The point total is from mostly offers and contests, to give it perspective, remember that 1 point is equal to 1 cent, so take whatever number you see in the points total and divide by 100 to get the cash equivalent. As of 07/17/2015 the total of the two is close to 800.00$.

 Next up, we have the testimonials widget provided by the site, there is a whole forum section dedicated to proof located <a href="http://www.points2shop.com/forum/8/Proof/1" target="_blank">here</a> where people share the items they have gotten from the site. This handy widget gives you some quick examples. As you will see, electronics are very popular, I am not promising you will earn a PS4 or an Xbox One in a week, but they are obtainable goals.
 You can also take a look at <a href="http://www.points2shop.com/members/profile/phatgreendog" target="_blank">My Profile</a> in addition to giving some of my stats you can see the stuff I personally have ordered and received, mostly books, DVD's, and games.

<p>Silver level members also get access to manual offers, these offers are manually approved by a site administrator, making them a guaranteed approval offer. One of them involves making a promotion video for the site, this is the one I made several years ago. The quality is lessened from the original version, YouTube removed but I recently got them to put it back up. Whatever server they use to house removed videos must save them at a much lower quality format but here it is.</p>

Lastly is a short video I made showing some of the stuff I have gotten over the years from doing this. i will show you <a href="http://www.points2shop.com/members/profile/phatgreendog" target="_blank">My Profile</a> then switch back to show you the actual item in my hands.
