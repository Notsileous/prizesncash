 <h1>How It Works</h1>
  <p>
  The web site I have been steering you to this whole time is called <a href="http://www.points2shop.com?ref=phatgreendog">Points2Shop.com</a> and is what as known as a "Get Paid To" site or GPT. Meaning you as the user get paid to complete surveys or complete offers. Sound to easy? It is really no different than normal commercial advertising, if a company wants to drive traffic to a new app or program they have available, they can partner with a GPT site and say "hey will give you fifty cents for every person you get to download and try our program". The GPT site in turn will make the program available on their site and record and credit people who use it, they take little off the top for their own expenses and give the rest to the users.
  </p>
  <p>
  Users have a choice of either earning points or money when completing offers, they used to have a sister site called Cashle that handled the money offers but now it all under one roof. Users can set their preference between the two in there settings, 1 point is equal to 1 cent in US currency. Points can be used to buy items from Amazon and cash and be withdrawn in a variety of ways. Cash can also be converted to points but not the other way around. Every offer will give points, but not every offer has a cash option available.
  </p>
  <h1>What Can You Get?</h1>
  <p>
  The short answer is, almost anything, Points2Shop has partnered with Amazon to provide almost limitless prize options. Anything available on Amazon can be ordered directly through the site, cash can be withdrawn through PayPal or similar sites, and there is also a wide selection of gift cards, some of which can be received instantly through e-mail! Want proof? click <a href="proof.html">here</a> to see what I and other users have gotten.
  </p>
<h1>How Do I Start?</h1>
<p>
From here on, any <a href="http://www.points2shop.com?ref=phatgreendog">Points2Shop</a> link you see or image will bring you to the site,it will also contain my referral information so I get the credit for you signing up. Use the links below to navigate throughout the sections, you can also visit the <a href="proof.html">Proof</a> and <a href="tips.html">Tips & Tricks</a> pages for more help.

<a id ="signup"><h2>Signing up</h2></a>
<hr class ="headings"/>
<p>
Navigate to <a href="http://www.points2shop.com?ref=phatgreendog">Points2Shop</a> and choose a unique username and password and enter your e-mail address. At this stage you need to enter a real and accurate e-mail address, the only e-mail you will receive from Points2Shop are account and offer related, you can opt out of offer messages in your settings. You will receive your first e-mail shorty asking you to verify the address, follow the instructions in your e-mail, once you verify your address you will receive 250 points as a sign up bonus.

<a id="offers"><h2>Types Of Offers</h2></a>
<hr class="headings"/>
<p>
The bulk of available offers are surveys, these can range from cars to movies to food and drink and everything in between and can be worth as little as 25 points or as much as 300 or more (.25 cents and 3.00$ respectively). You will not qualify for every survey, most will ask for some basic information about you first such as age, gender, and hobbies. If you do not fit the demographic of who they are looking for you will not be able to complete it, but don't worry there are hundreds more available.
<img src="images/offers.gif" alt ="A picture of some of the available offers" class="left"/>
</p>
<p>
The other offers available usually require you to sign up for something like newsletters or free samples, or even sometimes download a game or application. These offers tend to have a low approval rate and require more effort on the part of the user. See the <a href="tips.html">Tips & Tricks</a> section for more on how to complete these offers and have them approve.
</p>
<a id="verify"><h2>Get Verified</h2></a>
<hr class="headings"/>
<p>
To get the most of your P2S experience, you need to be address verified, which means you need to order something. Lucky for you, the nice folks at P2S gave you 250 points for signing up. Navigate to "Spend points" at the top of your screen and then go to "Low cost rewards" as seen below. <img src="images/earnings.gif" alt=" a picture of the menus needed to navigate for low cost rewards" height="150" width ="600" class="left"/>
There are numerous rewards you can get with your points, most are not very exciting like stickers and erasers, but the point is to get verified and the points were free. You can also order a one dollar bill for 100 points, that is a one time deal that cannot be repeated.
</p>
<a id="honor"><h2>Honor Levels</h2></a>
<hr class="headings"/>
<p>
Currently there are 8 different honor levels starting with "New User" and ending with "Legend". Each honor level has different requirements to attain such as length of membership and total amount earned. All users start at "New", once you become address verified you will be promoted to bronze (the second level). Each level has its own set of abilities and responsibilities associated with it, for example Bronze users are able to order E-mail gift cards and  "Gold" the fourth level allows for instant PayPal withdrawals and a bigger variety of offers. You will never have to pay to level up, simply use the site and you will get there eventually. Pay a visit to the <a href="honor.html">Honor Levels</a> page for a more detailed overview.
</p>
<a id="refs"><h2>Referrals</h2></a>
<hr class="headings"/>
<p>
Referrals are a great way to make more money from the site, you can make a site like this, or simply promote it on Facebook,Twitter, or any other social media site. For every user that signs up under your referral, you get .50 cents once they verify their account, if they complete an offer worth more .1 cents you will get another .50 cents <img src="images/ref_tree.gif" alt="A picture of the points2shop referral tree" class="floatleft" height ="200" width="200"/> you also get 15% of everything they earn as well as a little bit from their referrals. The dollar bonus is only for referrals from the US and UK, referrals from other countries will give you some as well just not as much. If you visit the <a href="proof.html">Proof</a> section you can see some more details of my earnings but I have made roughly $380.00 just from referrals.

<a id="games"><h2>Games and Contests</h2></a>
<hr class="headings"/>
<p>
Once you reach Silver level (the third level) you will be able to participate in games and contests for extra points. There are simple head to head games where you pay a points entrance fee and if you win you it get it back and then some. There is also a weekly lottery, a daily number limbo game and several contests for offer completions and referrals. These are of course completely optional and understand that they are games of chance and there is a chance of loosing, some have better odds than others.

<a id="mobile"><h2>Mobile Site</h2></a>
<hr class="headings"/>
<p>
Take Points2Shop with you everywhere you go by downloading the mobile app, not only can you still take surveys but you can also complete numerous mobile only offers like downloading free apps. There is an app available for Ios and android devices as well as a HTML 5 version for other mobile operating systems that simply opens in the browser.
